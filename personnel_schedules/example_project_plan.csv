Day 1,"Understand core OOPs concepts: Classes, Objects, Attributes, and Methods. Practice by defining a simple class (e.g., 'Book' or 'Dog') with relevant attributes and methods. Create multiple objects of this class and demonstrate their interaction."
Day 2,"Focus on Encapsulation. Learn about access modifiers (public, private, protected). Implement private attributes and public getter/setter methods for the class created on Day 1. Understand and apply constructors (default and parameterized) to initialize objects."
Day 3,"Dive into Inheritance. Understand 'IS-A' relationship. Create a base class (e.g., 'Animal' or 'Vehicle') and then create two derived classes (e.g., 'Dog', 'Cat' or 'Car', 'Motorcycle'). Demonstrate how derived classes inherit attributes and methods from the base class, and use 'super' keyword for constructor calls."
Day 4,"Explore Polymorphism. Implement Method Overloading (multiple methods with the same name but different parameters within a class) and Method Overriding (redefining a method from a parent class in a child class). Practice with the inheritance hierarchy created on Day 3, showcasing dynamic method dispatch."
Day 5,"Grasp Abstraction. Understand and implement abstract classes and abstract methods. Learn about Interfaces and their role in defining contracts. Practice by designing a system that uses both an abstract class (e.g., 'Shape' with an 'area' method) and an interface (e.g., 'Printable' with a 'printDetails' method), and implement them in concrete classes."
