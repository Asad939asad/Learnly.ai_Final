day,work
Day 1,"Introduction to Python: Install Python and VS Code (or preferred IDE). Learn basic syntax, variables, data types (int, float, string, boolean), and basic arithmetic operations. Practice using the `print()` and `input()` functions. Complete exercises on variable assignment and basic I/O."
Day 2,"Control Flow: Understand and practice `if`, `elif`, `else` statements for conditional logic. Learn about `for` loops, including iterating with `range()`. Explore `while` loops and practice using `break` and `continue` statements. Complete exercises involving decision-making and repetition."
Day 3,"Data Structures I - Lists & Tuples: Learn how to create, access, modify, and manipulate Python lists (indexing, slicing, adding/removing elements, common methods like `append()`, `pop()`, `sort()`). Understand tuples, their immutability, and when to use them. Complete exercises on list manipulation and basic tuple operations."
Day 4,"Data Structures II - Dictionaries & Sets: Explore dictionaries: creating, accessing values by keys, adding/modifying key-value pairs, and common methods (`keys()`, `values()`, `items()`). Introduce sets for unique collections. Practice using these structures to store and retrieve data efficiently. Complete exercises on dictionary and set operations."
Day 5,"Functions: Learn how to define and call your own functions. Understand parameters, arguments (positional and keyword), default arguments, and return values. Explore variable scope (local vs. global). Practice writing reusable functions to solve simple problems."
Day 6,"Modules, Error Handling & File I/O: Learn to import and use built-in modules (e.g., `math`, `random`). Understand how to handle runtime errors using `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks. Practice reading from and writing to text files using `open()` and the `with` statement."
Day 7,"Project & Review: Work on a small project that integrates concepts from the past 6 days (e.g., a simple command-line guessing game, a basic calculator, or a task list manager). Review any challenging topics and explore resources for continued learning (e.g., documentation, online communities, more advanced tutorials)."
