day,work
Day 1,"Set up Python environment (install Python and VS Code/PyCharm Community). Learn basic Python syntax: variables, data types (int, float, string, bool), `print()` function, user input with `input()`, and basic arithmetic operators. Practice writing simple scripts."
Day 2,"Master control flow: conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) and loops (`for` loops with `range()` and iterating over sequences, `while` loops). Understand `break` and `continue` keywords. Solve 3-5 simple challenges using conditionals and loops (e.g., check even/odd, sum numbers in a range)."
Day 3,"Explore fundamental data structures: Lists (creation, accessing, slicing, methods like `append`, `insert`, `remove`, `sort`), Tuples (creation, immutability), and Dictionaries (creation, key-value pairs, accessing, adding/removing elements). Practice using these structures to store and manipulate collections of data."
Day 4,"Understand and create user-defined functions: defining functions with `def`, passing arguments, using parameters, and returning values with `return`. Learn about variable scope (local vs. global). Practice writing functions to encapsulate reusable logic (e.g., a function to calculate an area, a function to reverse a string)."
Day 5,"Learn about Python modules: importing standard modules (e.g., `math`, `random`), and how to create and import your own modules. Introduce basic error handling using `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks to gracefully manage common exceptions (e.g., `ValueError`, `TypeError`)."
Day 6,Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Understand classes and objects. Define a simple class with attributes and methods. Learn about the `__init__` method (constructor) and the `self` keyword. Create multiple instances (objects) of your class. Practice by building a basic 'Car' or 'Animal' class.
Day 7,"Work with File I/O: Learn how to read from and write to text files using `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, and the `with` statement for automatic file closing. Apply all learned concepts by building a small command-line project, such as a simple To-Do List application that stores tasks in a file, or a basic calculator."
