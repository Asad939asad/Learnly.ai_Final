day,work
Day 1,"Review CUDA programming model basics: host vs. device, kernel launch syntax. Verify CUDA toolkit installation and run a simple 'Hello World' CUDA program. Practice using `cudaGetDeviceProperties`."
Day 2,"Implement a vector addition kernel. Practice global memory allocation (`cudaMalloc`), deallocation (`cudaFree`), and data transfers (`cudaMemcpy`). Experiment with different block and grid dimensions."
Day 3,Focus on shared memory. Implement a simple matrix transpose or a block-wise sum reduction using shared memory. Practice `__syncthreads()` for intra-block synchronization.
Day 4,"Explore constant memory for read-only data. Implement an example using constant memory. Integrate robust CUDA error checking (`cudaGetLastError`, `cudaError_t`) into all previous programs."
Day 5,"Understand warp-level primitives. Implement a simple warp-level reduction (e.g., using `__shfl_sync`). Practice atomic operations (`atomicAdd`, `atomicMax`) to prevent race conditions in global memory."
Day 6,"Learn about CUDA streams for asynchronous execution. Modify a previous program (e.g., vector addition) to use multiple streams to overlap data transfers and kernel computations. Understand `cudaMemcpyAsync`."
Day 7,"Introduction to profiling with NVIDIA Nsight Systems/Compute or `nvprof`. Profile a previous CUDA program to identify performance bottlenecks (e.g., memory bandwidth, occupancy). Attempt basic optimizations based on profiling data."
Day 8,Implement an optimized matrix multiplication kernel using shared memory tiling and careful memory access patterns. Compare its performance against a naive global memory implementation.
Day 9,Practice various reduction strategies. Implement a parallel sum reduction using both shared memory and warp-level operations. Study the concept of scan (prefix sum) and attempt a simplified implementation.
Day 10,"Comprehensive review of all CUDA concepts: memory hierarchy, kernel launch, synchronization, streams, error handling, and optimization techniques. Solve 2-3 new practice problems that combine multiple concepts, focusing on efficient implementation."
