Day 1,"Understand core OOP concepts: Classes, Objects, Attributes, and Methods. Practice by creating simple classes (e.g., a 'Dog' or 'Car' class) with attributes (name, color) and methods (bark(), drive()). Instantiate objects and interact with their attributes and methods using your chosen programming language."
Day 2,"Focus on Encapsulation and Abstraction. Learn about access modifiers (public, private, protected where applicable). Implement encapsulation using private attributes and public getters/setters. Understand abstract classes and interfaces; practice creating an abstract base class and a concrete derived class or an interface with multiple implementations."
Day 3,Dive into Inheritance. Understand how to create base (parent) and derived (child) classes. Practice single inheritance by creating a 'Vehicle' base class and 'Car' and 'Motorcycle' derived classes. Explore method overriding where a child class redefines a method from its parent.
Day 4,"Explore Polymorphism. Understand compile-time (method overloading, if supported) and run-time (method overriding, interface implementation) polymorphism. Practice creating a collection of objects of different types that share a common interface or base class, and call a polymorphic method on them (e.g., a list of 'Shape' objects, each with a 'draw()' method)."
Day 5,"Consolidate your learning by building a small project that integrates all OOP principles (Classes, Objects, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism). Examples include a simple 'Library Management System' (with Book, Member, Library classes) or a 'Zoo Simulation' (with an Animal hierarchy). Design your classes, implement relationships, and demonstrate all learned concepts."
