Day 1,"Understand core OOP principles (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction) and their advantages. Learn Class and Object basics: definition, creation, attributes, methods."
Day 2,"Deep dive into Classes and Objects: Constructors (default, parameterized, copy), 'this' keyword, static members (variables, methods, blocks), and their usage."
Day 3,"Focus on Encapsulation: Learn access specifiers (public, private, protected, default/package-private), how to achieve data hiding, and implement getters and setters."
Day 4,"Study Inheritance: Understand its purpose, different types (single, multilevel, hierarchical, hybrid), 'super' keyword, and basic method overriding concepts."
Day 5,Explore Polymorphism (Part 1 - Compile-time/Static): Master method overloading (different signatures) and revisit method overriding as a base for runtime polymorphism.
Day 6,"Explore Polymorphism (Part 2 - Runtime/Dynamic) and Abstraction (Part 1): Understand dynamic method dispatch, abstract classes, abstract methods, and their roles."
Day 7,"Focus on Abstraction (Part 2): Learn Interfaces, differences between abstract classes and interfaces, and their practical application. Review Association, Aggregation, and Composition."
Day 8,"Study Exception Handling: Understand 'try', 'catch', 'finally' blocks, 'throw' and 'throws' keywords, checked vs. unchecked exceptions, and how to create custom exceptions."
Day 9,"Review all core OOP concepts, practice small coding examples for each principle, and understand miscellaneous important keywords like 'final' (variables, methods, classes)."
Day 10,"Solve comprehensive practice problems, tackle previous year's exam questions, and take a full-length mock test to assess understanding and time management."
